UTCompOmni - Omnipotents version of UTComp 

Server installation

Copy these folders to the UT2004 folder:

Sounds\
StaticMeshes\
Textures\
System\


The original UTComp help file is in the Help\ folder

Snarf's recommended settings for Omnipotents 2.0 server are in the UT2004.ini file.  
Copy all contents of this file to the bottom of the server's UT2004.ini file.

Clients/players can hit F5 during gameplay to set their own settings (turn off hit sounds, change brightskins, etc).


A list of ignored hit sounds is also in the UT2004.ini file.

To add more sounds to ignore, add a new line with the damage type of the sound to ignore, e.g.

IgnoredHitSounds=FireKill
IgnoredHitSounds=DamTypeChargingBeam    


This would ignore the fire burning of firetank and beam weapon of the hell bender.
