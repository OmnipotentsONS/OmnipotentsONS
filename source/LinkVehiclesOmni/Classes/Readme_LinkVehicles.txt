ONSToys1Mesh (Mesh from orignal)


Variants:

LinkTank3Heavy (3 seats, plasma turret, link turret, all with stacking link, 1200 pts) Basically the current Link Tank 2.0 (ONSlaughtToys1 Kamek) with a bit more health.
Ready to Test.

LinkTank3 (3 seats, stacking, 800 pts) This is the "older" link tank 2.0
Ready to Test

VampireTank (1 seat, similar to Chupa, Dark theme, faster speed) Started with 1000 health can go to 1500 too high?
Alt-Fire (Ion shockwave) doesn't seem to do damage, might rather have stormcaster, work to be done.

LinkScorp, link, stack, alt-fire is boost like EONS scorp. So this could be a fast nimble link vehicle, like a half version of the link badger.
Ready to Test


Tick, link, no stack, self heal to some high health (say 650-800, start with 250, and increase in mass), alt-fire could be plasma gun (the scorp blades are nearly useless) (or maybe Webcaster primary)
ToDo: DrawScale on Gun, Blades.  Not sure how to fix...

Lamprey - Manta that grapples on and drains health (healing itself too!)
- Not Started.

- The Wraith/Odin do NOT stack because draining health and healing is too OP IMO -- Chupa (link flyer) is too OP IMO
The Wraith/Odin/Chupa have their own packages/

- There's also a bug in the Odin that it can heal itself, which I meant to fix, but its kind of a fun feature in that tank..

And we also have the Link Badger (1000 pts) kind of fits in between, but its a bit OP IMO, but its a favorite so that's not included here, and if I changed it McLovin would hunt me down.
