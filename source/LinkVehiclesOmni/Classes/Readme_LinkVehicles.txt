Variants:

LinkTank3Heavy (3 seats, plasma turret, link turret, all with stacking link, 1200 pts) Basically the current Link Tank 2.0 (ONSlaughtToys1 Kamek) with a bit more health.
To Do: Beam Colors, Verify, Fix DamageTypes

LinkTank (2 seats, no laser turret, stacking, 800 pts) This is the "older" link tank

VampireTank (1 seat, similar to Chupa, Dark theme, faster speed) Maybe this should be more, or "DarkLinkTank type" shock tank/centaur type vehicle. 500 health, maybe healable to 1000 or 1200. 
Not sure it should stack, if it heals is enough of an advantage

LinkScorp, link, stack, alt-fire is boost like EONS scorp. So this could be a fast nimble link vehicle, like a half version of the link badger.
To DO:  Beam Color Green, Change Scorp Texture
Beam color to be green not Purple, but verify first can copy it for the Tick.

Tick, link, no stack, self heal to some high health (say 650-800, start with 250, and increase in mass), alt-fire could be plasma gun (the scorp blades are nearly useless) (or maybe Webcaster primary)


Link Scorpion which is pretty weak maybe it should have healing too?


- The Wraith/Odin do NOT stack because draining health and healing is too OP IMO -- Chupa (link flyer) is too OP IMO
The Wraith/Odin/Chupa have their own packages/

- There's also a bug in the Odin that it can heal itself, which I meant to fix, but its kind of a fun feature in that tank..

And we also have the Link Badger (1000 pts) kind of fits in between, but its a bit OP IMO, but its a favorite so that's not included here, and if I changed it McLovin would hunt me down.
